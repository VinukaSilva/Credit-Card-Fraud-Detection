# **Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection**

## Experimental Design

- **Algorithm Selection**: This research is basically based on whether the performance of a Neural Network would significantly differ if one part of the algorithm's configuration is changed. Firstly, a multi-layer perceptron with 1-hidden layer was trained followed by a multi-layer perceptron with 2 hidden layers. 

- **Testable Hypothesis**: A neural network's performance on the Credit-Card Fraud dataset is affected by the number of hidden layers.
  - **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: Insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis.
  - **Alternate Hypothesis (H1)**: Evidence suggests the hypothesis is likely true.
  
  This means that if the null hypothesis is accepted, there is no significant difference between the performance of the two MLPs with a different number of hidden layers. However, if the null hypothesis is rejected, i.e., the alternate hypothesis is accepted, it implies that changing the number of hidden layers in the neural network has a significant difference in the performance of the model.
